* QUESTION:
* You have a natural number n. Generate a sequence of integers, described in the Collatz conjecture:
* 
* If n is an even number, divide it in half, if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this operation until you get 1 as a result.
* 
* For example, if n is 17, then the sequence would look like this: 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
* This sequence should stop at 1 for any primary natural number n.
*
* Output format:
* A sequence of integers in a single line, separated by spaces.
